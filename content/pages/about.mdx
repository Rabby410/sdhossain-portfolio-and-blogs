title: ABOUT ME
---

My name is Shahadath Hossain. I successfully graduated from the University of East London as a software Engineer, in the computer science faculty.

During my university years, I developed a deep passion for web programming, and I consistently engaged in learning new concepts and techniques in this field.

So, officially, my programming journey began in 2017 as a web developer.

I enjoy learning technologies that interest me, which is why I dedicated a significant amount of time to working with Web based application.

One day, I decided to try something new, and I started learning React. I was so excited to see how fast I can build a website with it, and how easy it is to maintain it. Consequently, I quickly learned Next.js and I used it to build some company projects working in a team with a backend dev.

In December 2023, I had an opportunity to start working as a Full Stack developer for a company with the possibility of transitioning to web development. I was skeptical about it at first, but I decided to give it a try, and I don‘t regret it. Now, I thoroughly enjoy working with Laravel, React.js and Next.js.
